This is my sandbox project where I follow along with Vue 3 + Pinia documentation and try things out in code. Itâ€™s a live experiment: I read, apply, break things, and learn.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Goals

To walk through the official Vue 3 docs and experiment with features in a real project

To practice state management using Pinia and see how it fits into a Vue 3 app

To explore common patterns: components, reactivity, composition API, store modules, etc.

To build small examples as learning aids (rather than a polished app)
